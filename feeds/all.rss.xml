With that in mind, I've decided to try out something new and go for a custom domain and a new blog engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this, then you already know the new domain :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the blog up and running, I've opted for &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python-based static site generator.
I think that static pages are a perfect fit for blogs and I really, really, REALLY wanted to move away the Blogger platform.
The choice of engine itself is a bit random, I don't really have any experience of static site generators, so I just picked one that seemed to fit the bill.
It's part of the whole experiment, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll attempt to host this on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I get to use Vim to edit posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping things work out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">dtsomp</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blog.dtsomp.net,2018-08-11:/hello-world.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
